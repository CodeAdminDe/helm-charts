![Version: 0.1.1](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version-0.1.1-informational?style=flat-square) ![Type: library](https://img.shields.io/badge/Type-library-informational?style=flat-square) ![AppVersion: 0.1.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/AppVersion-0.1.0-informational?style=flat-square)

A (experimental) Helm chart of cilium network policies for usage as a library chart.

## TL;DR

This is a library chart.
Library charts cannot be installed via `helm install`, instead they're used within application charts to provide default / common configurations.

> If the application you'd like to install depends on this library, you'd find more info about it inside the related application chart.

## Installation

To install the library chart you'd have to install a application which depends on it.
Library charts cannot be installed standalone.

## Uninstallation

To uninstall the chart you'd have to uninstall the application chart which depends on it.

## Opinionated & Non-standard

Please note that this chart is highly opinionated and may therefore not be ideal for your environment and/or does not meet the typical standard for helm charts.

Therefore, I'm very happy if you find the chart/s provided here helpful and perhaps even use it in your environment,
but at the same time I strongly advise you to take a close look at it and adapt it to your needs where necessary.

If you would like to return any helpful changes, I would also be happy to receive a pull request or two ;-)

### About libchart-cnpg provided policies

> The Cilium network policies included reflect my personal deployment preferences.
> It is likely that they do not meet your cluster and/or security requirements.
> Therefore, you must review them yourself, and I accept no responsibility for any (security) issues or other challenges that may arise when using this chart, either directly or indirectly.

#### CiliumNetworkPolicies-NamespaceSet

Returns the default baseline for namespace-wide policies.
Note that when you're overriding within your app chart:
* the override applies for all resources - e.g
  * adding a non-existing label would be added to all CNPs listed.
  * overriding spec: is not recommended because it would set the same spec for all rules.

#### CiliumNetworkPolicies-CnpgSet

Returns a full set of rules to allow communication between the CNPG operator and database clusters within the applications namespace.
Note that when you're overriding within your app chart:
* the override applies for all resources - e.g
  * adding a non-existing label would be added to all CNPs listed.
  * overriding spec: is not recommended because it would set the same spec for all rules.

#### CiliumNetworkPolicies-AppSet

Returns an app-specific policy. This need to be overriden by the application chart.
It's here to provide a scaffold for your application-specific chart.
Therefore, it would block ingress/egress traffic when unconfigured.

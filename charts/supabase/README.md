|------------|------|---------|
| https://codeadminde.github.io/supabase-kubernetes | supabase(supabase) | 0.4.3 |

## TL;DR

You don't want to read through the docs? That's the quick and dirty way:

```bash
helm repo add codeadminde https://codeadminde.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update
helm install supabase codeadminde/supabase
```
_**Note**: If you want to speicify a namespace, provide the name via the `-n` (or `--namespace`) flag. You need to create the desired namespace beforhand._

> I'd recommend to read trough the docs. Skip them at your own risk. ;-)

## Repository

In order to install / query / etc... the charts, you'll need to add the repository:

```bash
helm repo add codeadminde https://codeadminde.github.io/helm-charts/
helm repo update
```

## Installation

To install the chart with the release name `supabase`

```bash
helm install supabase codeadminde/supabase
```
_**Note**: If you want to speicify a namespace, provide the name via the `-n` (or `--namespace`) flag. You need to create the desired namespace beforhand._

## Uninstallation

To uninstall the chart release named `supabase`

```bash
helm uninstall supabase
```
_**Note**: If you want to speicify a namespace, provide the name via the `-n` (or `--namespace`) flag. You need to create the desired namespace beforhand._

The command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart **including persistent volumes** and deletes the release.

## Configuration

Take a look at the [values.yaml](./values.yaml) file of the chart. It contains the default configuration and additional notes.
So it would be a good idea to take a look at it, even if you already know what you would like to accomplish.

To configure the release (chart values), provide your own values via a *.yaml file and reference it with the `-f` flag.

> #### Sample
>
> ```bash
> helm install supabase codeadminde/supabase -f values.yaml
> ```

Alternatively, you could provide the values which you want to override at the CLI directly. Than you've to provide the values as key=value pair(s), referenced by the `--set` flag.

> #### Sample
>
> ```bash
> helm install supabase --set key=value --set keyTwo=secondValue codeadminde/supabase
> ```

## Values

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
|-----|------|---------|-------------|
| supabase | object | `{"enabled":true}` | Just enable the dependency, because its a proxy chart for https://github.com/CodeAdminDe/supabase-kubernetes Take a look at the dependency chart values.yaml and update at least security related values!! |

## Chart without NetworkPolicies

Please note that this chart does not provide any network policies itself.
Therefore, I recommend the implementation of network policies before using in prod environments.

## Opinionated & Non-standard

Please note that this chart is highly opinionated and may therefore not be ideal for your environment and/or does not meet the typical standard for helm charts.

Therefore, I'm very happy if you find the chart/s provided here helpful and perhaps even use it in your environment,
but at the same time I strongly advise you to take a close look at it and adapt it to your needs where necessary.

If you would like to return any helpful changes, I would also be happy to receive a pull request or two ;-)

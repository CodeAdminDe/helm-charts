# > The container runtime configuration is used to run a Pod's containers. . . .
# > For example, if part of your workload deserves a high level of information security assurance, you might choose to schedule those Pods so that they run in a container runtime that uses hardware virtualization.
# > You'd then benefit from the extra isolation of the alternative runtime, at the expense of some additional overhead. . . .
